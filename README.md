## reolink adapter for ioBroker

Adapter for ioBroker Plattform to get Reolink camera information.

In general all newer Reolink cameras support API commands. They just differ in their supported commands.


There are also Set API Commands. I plan to add them later.

If you wish to have any specific API command included...just let me now.


### Supported Devices

RLC-510A

### tested Devices

RLC-810A
RLC-823A

### Example Usage of get image:

```
sendTo("reolink.0",{action: "snap"}, function(result){
    sendTo("matrix-org.0",{file:result});
});
```
// content from **result** is JSON :
```
{type:"image/png",base64:"iVBORw....askldfj"}
```
